# CanvasMenu
A simple, lightweight and easy to use Android library with lots of customizations.
Ideal for minimal design, making complex UI easier to maintain.
Give your app a brand new menu, coz drawers are too mainstream.

Read instructions before cimplementing into your project.
It is the initial build so don't expect any more than what's documented.
More features and flexibility will be added in upcoming builds.

All the options shown in the menu are for demonstration purpose only and do not have any reletion with the library itself.
CanvasMenu has as may implementations as you can imagine.
Use it as a navigation drawer, toolset or just a menu, choice is yours.

Happy compiling!"
